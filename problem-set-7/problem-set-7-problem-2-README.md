## It's Your Song

Write a Python program that takes the lyrics from your favorite song and prints them out using functions. Your solution should not simply print out the lyrics sequentially but, use functions to repeat verses from the song that are repetitive. Use different functions for different sections of the song. Have a main() function, handle the mainline logic.
